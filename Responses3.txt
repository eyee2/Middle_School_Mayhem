--Ordinarily, you enjoy gym class. Today, however, you're beyond ready. You tried some creatine powder you took from a sketchy eighth grader in the locker room.

--You feel large, and in charge, as they say. Today's the day that everything changes... You were once the nerd, but now, now, you're hopped up on C4 preworkout.

--You enter the gym as if a demigod gracing the field of battle with your divine prescence. The game starts, and you pick up a dodgeball.

--The ball feels light in your hand. The better for you, since your target is far. 

--There, in the corner of your eye, you spot the leviathan that terrorizes your group of friends, with that smug, psych-major look of blissful ignorance on their face.

--Your enemy is looking away. D**n fool. You bring your arm back, put your enemy in the sights, and unleash a world of hurt delived via soft inflated rubber ball.

--As your father, Oden, stares in dumbstruck awe, the ball tears a hole in the space-time continuum, and rockets towards your destination.

--The ball makes contact, as a thunderclap of face meeting ball erupts.

--Your target falls to the ground, writhing in pitiful mortal anguish.

--"Nice one!" says Mr. Micklo.

--Your enemies cronies drag their helpless leader's ruined corpse from the gym.

--Five fifth graders from another class run over, dropping to their knees in genuflect. "We're not worthy, we're not worthy!" they cry.

--You turn to the youngest of them and say, "Sic semper tyrannus."

--You sluggishly saunter onto the court feeling something drop in your stomach.

--Ordinarily you wouldn't mind missing a single game of dodgeball, but today, SMOL, your gender neutral crush is playing on your team. This is your chance to show him or her your physical prowess and worth as a mate.

--You push on trying to ignore the rumblies in your tumblies.

--You haven't prepared for this. You're not sure where to divert your attention to; protecting SMOL, thinning the ranks of your enemies, or keeping yourself composed.

--Blindsided from being distracted for so long you're hit directly in the stomach with what could only be the throw of a norse god.

--Clenching your stomach from agony you've done it! You caught the ball that was to be your undoing!

--SMOL has noticed this achievement and runs to your side to congratulate you with a high five. The excitement coupled with the burning in your thorax is too much to handle.

--The force of the throw is redirected through your body and the questionable eggs you ate for breakfast suddenly make a reappearence... right onto SMOL as they(SMOL) keep their hand ready to recieve yours.

--Mr. Micklo reels back in horror, "Go to the nurses office."

--Horrified and unable to face SMOL you dejectedly walk to the nurses office to wait for your mom to pick you up.

--"YOU CHOSE POORLY"

--Maybe tomorrow will be better. Or maybe it won't.

--Overall score 5/7
