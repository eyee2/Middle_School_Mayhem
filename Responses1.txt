--You chose to take the bus! Walking into first period you take your usually prescribed seat, ready to dogmatically respond and absorb to the physical science spoonfed to you by your teacher.

"Okay class, who knows the weight of the earth?" Mr. Gendum lazily asks.

"I think you mean the MASS of the earth, Mr. Gendum," you sarcastically retort.

"Well if you wish to qualify that statement with an asnwer to my question, please feel free, otherwise refrain from attempting to enlighten the class with your feigned intelligence"

--A hush falls over the class...

--You can feel the stares of all your peers as your face turns an extreme shade of red.

--You sheepishly sink into the back of your seat and defeatedly mutter, "Yes Mr. Gendum."

--You had a nice ride to school with your mother. Naturally, you were ten minutes late to class.

--Strolling confidently through the door you haughtily toss the folded late pass onto Mr. Gendum's desk.

"Nice of you to show up, Mister or Miss. Maybe you could illuminate the rest of the class by answering the question on the board?"

--You look at the board and see the following question, "Which medieval siege weapon is capable of launching a 90kg object over 300 metres away?"

--You let out a small scoff and cooly remark, "Well, not a catapult."

--"You're not incorrect, Mister or Miss. But what siege weapon is it?"

--"A trebuchet, obviously. What else would it be?" you add, with blatant sass.

--You take your seat, and note the validating giggles and smirks from your peers. You browse reddit and know about r/trebuchetmemes? You're well on your way to a degree in engineering!
